**CyberBee** is an educational and social initiative aimed at **returning to the roots of the internet** – a time when online communication was based on **respect, empathy, and responsibility**.

The project involves **rewriting the rules of Netiquette from scratch**, adapted to the realities of:
- 📱 modern social media  
- 🤖 AI and algorithms  
- ⚡ instant reaction culture  

## 🌼 Main Project Idea

🐝 **CyberBee aims to be a shared place on the web** that:

- 📚 **collects and organizes netiquette rules** (classic and new),
- 🧠 **explains concepts** related to communication culture, hate, disinformation, and online responsibility,
- 🔗 **gathers links to trusted sources**, articles, research, and educational materials,
- 🤝 **highlights organizations, foundations, and initiatives** that:
  - counteract hate,
  - support victims of online violence,
  - educate about safe and responsible internet use.

CyberBee works like a **hive 🐝**:
> many sources → collective work → honey for everyone 🍯

### 💡 Co-creation
If you:
- know of **valuable resources**,  
- run or support **an initiative that fights hate**,  
- have links to **organizations, research, educational projects**,  

👉 **add them to the project** or send a link.  
CyberBee grows thanks to the community.

## 🌼 What is CyberBee?

CyberBee:

- 🐝 **collects nectar** of good practices from the web  
- 🚫 **filters hate**, disinformation, and communication chaos  
- 🍯 **produces "honey" of knowledge** - simple rules, definitions, tools, and daily micro-lessons of digital culture  

The project combines **education, reflection, and lightness of form** –  
👉 without moralizing  
👉 without superiority  

It's a movement for people who want to be **conscious internet users**, not just consumers.
