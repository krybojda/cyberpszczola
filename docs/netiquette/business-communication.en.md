## 🐝 Professional Online Communication

In a business environment, online communication requires special attention to professionalism, clarity, and respect.

## 📧 Business Email

### ✅ Good practices:

#### Message structure:
- **Subject:** Clear, specific, descriptive (e.g., "Question re: Project X - deadline" instead of "Question")
- **Greeting:** Formal, appropriate for the recipient
- **Content:** Concise, divided into paragraphs, with bullet points for clarity
- **Closing:** Polite, with a clear call-to-action
- **Signature:** Complete, with contact information

#### Tone and style:
- 🎯 **Be specific** - respect others' time
- 📝 **Write professionally** - avoid slang and emojis
- ⏰ **Respond within a reasonable time** - ideally within 24-48 hours
- 🔍 **Check before sending** - spelling errors ruin the impression

### ❌ What to avoid:
- ❌ Sending emails after work hours (unless urgent)
- ❌ "Reply all" unnecessarily - don't spam the whole team
- ❌ CAPS LOCK - it's online shouting
- ❌ Too casual tone on first contact
- ❌ Attachments without describing them in the content

## 💬 Business Messengers (Slack, Teams, Discord)

### ✅ Good practices:

#### Channels and messages:
- 📂 **Use appropriate channels** - don't mix topics
- 🧵 **Use threads** - maintain order
- 🔔 **Respect @mentions** - don't overuse @channel and @here
- 🎯 **One message instead of many** - edit instead of sending 10 short ones

#### Status and availability:
- 🟢 **Update status** - show when you're available
- 🔕 **Respect "Do Not Disturb"** - don't write urgent matters if there's another way
- ⏰ **Consider time zones** - especially in international teams

### ❌ What to avoid:
- ❌ Sending "Hi" and waiting for a response - write the whole message at once
- ❌ Spamming memes in work channels
- ❌ Ignoring threads - maintain context
- ❌ Constantly using @here for non-essential matters

## 🔗 LinkedIn and Networking

### ✅ Good practices:

#### Invitations:
- 💬 **Personalize invitations** - explain why you want to connect
- 🤝 **Build relationships, not contact collections**
- 🎓 **Share valuable content**

#### Communication:
- 📧 **Don't sell in the first message** - get to know the person first
- 💼 **Maintain professionalism** - this isn't Facebook
- 🎯 **Be specific in inquiries** - respect others' time

### ❌ What to avoid:
- ❌ Spam with offers immediately after accepting invitation
- ❌ Copying the same template to everyone
- ❌ Asking for endorsements without acquaintance
- ❌ Unsolicited business proposals

## 📹 Video Meetings (Zoom, Meet, Teams)

### ✅ Good practices:

#### Before the meeting:
- 🎥 **Check equipment** - camera, microphone, lighting
- 👔 **Dress appropriately** - professional background and appearance
- ⏰ **Join on time** - preferably 2-3 minutes early
- 📱 **Mute notifications** - avoid distractions

#### During the meeting:
- 🎤 **Microphone muted when not speaking** - eliminate noise
- 👁️ **Look at the camera when speaking** - builds connection
- ✋ **Use "raise hand" function** - don't interrupt
- 💬 **Chat for questions** - don't interrupt verbally without need

#### After the meeting:
- 📝 **Send summary** - if you were the host
- ✅ **Follow-up on agreements** - confirm decisions via email

### ❌ What to avoid:
- ❌ Eating on camera during formal meetings
- ❌ Multitasking - it's noticeable
- ❌ Inappropriate background (bed, mess)
- ❌ Constantly looking at phone

## 🎯 Special Situations

### Difficult conversations:
- 📧 **Choose the right medium** - serious topics better via video than text
- 🤝 **Be empathetic but specific**
- 📝 **Document agreements** - confirm via email

### Feedback:
- 💬 **1-on-1 for criticism** - don't criticize publicly
- 🎯 **Constructive and specific**
- 🤝 **Sandwich method** - positive, criticism, positive

### Conflicts:
- 🛑 **Don't escalate through text** - schedule a conversation
- 😤 **Never send emotionally** - take a break
- 🤝 **Seek solutions, not culprits**

## 🎯 Summary

> 💼 **Online professionalism = offline professionalism.**  
> 🐝 **In business, culture is an investment, not a cost.**  
> 🍯 **Respect in communication builds reputation.**
