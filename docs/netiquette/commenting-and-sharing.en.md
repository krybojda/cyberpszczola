## 🐝 Responsible Commenting and Sharing

Every comment and share is your voice in the online space. It has the power to influence others and shape online discourse.

## 💬 Commenting

### ✅ Rules for good comments:

#### 1. 🎯 Be substantive
- **Refer to the content**, not to the author's person
- Provide arguments, not just opinions
- If you disagree, explain why specifically

**Example of a good comment:**
> "Interesting point of view. From my experience, however, [specific example]. Have you considered this scenario?"

**Example of a bad comment:**
> "You're writing nonsense, you have no idea about the topic."

#### 2. 🤔 Read before commenting
- Read the entire article/post, not just the title
- Understand the context
- Check if someone hasn't already responded to your point

#### 3. 💡 Add value
- Share your experience
- Propose other perspectives
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Supplement information

#### 4. 🎭 Watch your tone
- No sarcasm, which can be misunderstood
- Use emojis for tone clarification (when appropriate)
- Remember: CAPS LOCK = SHOUTING

### ❌ What to avoid in comments:

#### 🚫 Common mistakes:
- **Whataboutism** - "What about [other topic]?" instead of addressing the topic
- **Ad hominem** - attacking the person instead of arguments
- **Strawman** - distorting the opponent's argument
- **False equivalence** - comparing incomparable things
- **Trolling** - deliberate provocation for fun

#### 💣 Never:
- Don't publish personal data (doxxing)
- Don't threaten
- Don't use offensive words
- Don't mock language mistakes
- Don't attack appearance, origin, orientation

## 🔄 Content Sharing

### ✅ Responsible sharing:

#### 1. 🔍 Verify before sharing

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- ✅ Have I checked the source?
- ✅ Is this original information or rewritten?
- ✅ Is the date current?
- ✅ Isn't this satire/parody?
- ✅ Does the title match the content?

**Verification tools:**
- Google Reverse Image Search (for images)
- Fact-checking sites (Snopes, AFP Fact Check)
- Source verification (is the site known, credible?)

#### 2. 📝 Add context

**When sharing:**
- Explain why you consider it valuable
- Add your comment with perspective
- Mark if it's controversial/unverifiable
- Warn if content may be triggering

**Example of good sharing:**
> "Interesting article on [topic]. Pay special attention to the point about [X]. Remember, this is one person's perspective, so it's also worth reading [other source]."

#### 3. 🤝 Respect authorship
- Cite source and author
- Don't crop watermarks from graphics
- Link to the original, not to rewritten content
- Don't pass off someone else's work as your own

### ❌ What NOT to share:

#### 🚫 Absolute "NO":
- **Fake news** - even with a comment "this is false" (algorithms promote reach)
- **Private information** without consent
- **Illegal content** (violence, child pornography, etc.)
- **Doxxing** - people's private data
- **Revenge porn** - intimate materials without consent

#### ⚠️ Be careful with:
- **Clickbait** - don't reward manipulative titles with reach
- **Hate speech** - even for criticism (report, don't share)
- **Chain messages** - "share onwards" is usually spam
- **Unverified info in crisis** - especially in threatening situations

## 🎯 Special Situations

### When you see fake news:
1. **DON'T share** - even with a warning
2. **Report** to the platform
3. **Inform privately** the person who shared it
4. **Share fact-check** instead of fake news

### When you see hate speech:
1. **DON'T react emotionally**
2. **Report** to moderation
3. **Support victim privately** (DM)
4. **Don't amplify** by sharing

### When you make a mistake:
1. **Admit it** openly
2. **Correct** the information
3. **Delete or update** the erroneous post
4. **Apologize** if it affected someone

## 💡 Good Practices

### 🌟 Golden rule:
> **Before commenting/sharing, ask yourself:**
> - Is it true?
> - Is it important?
> - Is it helpful?
> - Is it necessary?
> - Is it kind?

### 🐝 CyberBee principle:
> **More honey, less stings:**
> - Focus on positive comments
> - Praise more often than criticize
> - Share solutions, not just problems
> - Build, don't destroy

### 🍯 Domino effect:
Remember that:
- Your comment/share affects algorithms
- Reach = responsibility
- Your activity shapes the environment for everyone

## 🎯 Summary

> 🔍 **Before sharing - verify.**  
> 💬 **Before commenting - think.**  
> 🐝 **Your activity has power - use it wisely.**

**Final question:**
> Would I want my comment/share to represent me in 5 years?
