## 📜 New Netiquette - CyberBee Rules

### 1. 🧍 There's a human on the other side. Always.

**Remember** that behind every comment, post, or message is a real person with emotions, feelings, and a life story.

**Good practice examples:**
- Before writing something harsh, imagine saying it face-to-face
- Treat others as you would like to be treated

### 2. 🗣️ Don't write anything you wouldn't say out loud.

**The read-aloud test:** If you'd be embarrassed to say something out loud in front of family or friends, don't write it online.

**Reflection questions:**
- Would I say this to someone face-to-face?
- Would I be proud if my family read this?

### 3. 😤 Emotions are not arguments.

**Feelings ≠ facts**. Anger, frustration, or outrage are natural reactions, but they don't constitute an argument in a discussion.

**How to cope:**
- ⏸️ Take a break before responding when you're upset
- 📝 Write a response, but send it only after 10 minutes
- 🧘 Breathe - sometimes it's better not to respond at all

### 4. 🤫 Not everything requires a comment.

**Silence is also an answer.** You don't have to comment on every post, you don't need an opinion on every topic.

**When to hold back:**
- You don't know the context of the situation
- The topic is outside your area of knowledge
- Your comment doesn't add anything constructive
- You feel strong emotions

### 5. ❌ A mistake is not a reason for lynching, but for discussion.

**Everyone makes mistakes.** Instead of publicly shaming, try to understand and constructively point out the issue.

**How to respond to mistakes:**
- 💬 A private message often works better than a public comment
- 🤝 Suggest a solution, not just point out the problem
- 🎓 Treat it as an opportunity for education, not punishment

### 6. 📱 Painful truth and constructive criticism don't immediately mean it's hate.

**Criticism ≠ hate**. You can disagree and point out problems without insulting.

**Difference between criticism and hate:**

**Constructive criticism:**
- Refers to specific actions or ideas
- Is substantive and specific
- Proposes solutions
- Doesn't attack the person, only the action

**Hate:**
- Attacks the person, not the action
- Is vague and insulting
- Offers no solutions
- Aims to hurt, not help

### 7. 🔍 Before you share - verify.

**Check your sources.** In the era of fake news and disinformation, each of us is responsible for what we spread.

**How to verify information:**
- ✅ Check several independent sources
- 🔎 Use fact-checking sites (e.g., Snopes, AFP Fact Check)
- 📅 Check the publication date - is this current information?
- 🤔 Think: is the headline clickbait?

### 8. 🎭 Irony hurts more often than you think.

**Tone doesn't translate to text.** What would sound funny in conversation can be received as an attack online.

**Remember:**
- Lack of vocal tone and body language makes intentions harder to understand
- What's a joke to you may be pain to others
- Use emojis and tone indicators (e.g., "/s" for sarcasm) when necessary

### 9. 🤝 You have the right to disagree - you don't have the right to insult.

**Difference of opinion is natural and healthy.** Insulting others never is.

**How to disagree with respect:**
- "I understand your point of view, but I see it differently because..."
- "I respect your opinion, but my experience shows..."
- "We can disagree and that's okay"

### 10. 🤖 Algorithms don't absolve you of responsibility.

**Platforms may promote controversy, but you decide what you publish.**

**Remember:**
- Algorithms may reward controversial content with greater reach
- You're not forced to post provocative content for likes
- Your responsibility for words doesn't disappear even if algorithms promote them

### 11. 🕰️ The internet remembers longer than emotions.

**Once published content can take on a life of its own.** Deletion doesn't always mean disappearance.

**Before publishing, ask yourself:**
- Will I be proud of this in a year? In 5 years?
- Would I want my future employer to see this?
- Is this something I want in my digital history?
